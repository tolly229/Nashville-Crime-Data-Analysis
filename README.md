## Nashville_Crime_Data_Analysis

This project used Python Juptyr Notebook primarily to read, clean, and analyze data from 911 and non emergency calls to Nashville/Davidson County, TN requesting police assistance.

This exercise helped with the following:
1)draw and interpret diagrams of collaborative Git branching workflows.
2)create new branches with Git.
3)push local branches to GitHub.
4)pull upstream changes from GitHub.
5)pull from the appropriate branch(es) on GitHub.
6)merge their branches into their localmaster on the command line.
7)resolve merge conflicts on their computers.
8)request integration of their changes via PR.
9)approve and merge PRs from GitHub.
10)use git stash to save "dirty" changes to their working environment.


## Project Proposal

Our project is to uncover patterns in criminal activity around Nashville. We'll examine relationships between types of crime and location; crime rates and times of day; trends in crime rates over the course of the year; and related questions, as the data admits.



## Finding Data

Once your group has written an outline, it's time to start hunting for data. You are free to use data from any source, but we recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:


data.world
Kaggle
Data.gov
Public APIs
Awesome-APIs List
Medium APIs List


## Data Cleanup & Analysis


The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: Exploration & Cleanup and Analysis proper.

The analysis focuses on techniques such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis.
